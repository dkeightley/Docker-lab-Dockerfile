# Dockerfile Lab

Our manager has tasked us with a very important project, aparently customers are complaining that our Random Cat Generator has been down for some time. It's super urgent - Sev 1, interwebs down/down or something.

We only know a little bit about the app, and that the previous engineer who deployed it was our Senior Principal Full Stack Engineer who rage quit, and now all we have is the source code.

So far we know:

- It's a Python app
- That it ran in a Docker container before
- The network engineer said the container used to listen on port 5000/TCP, something about expos√®, maybe they were french?
- It was based on the ```python:alpine``` docker image
- There was mention of a ```requirements.txt``` file, and a ```pip install``` command?

### Steps

- Clone this repository
- Create a Dockerfile for this Python app
- Build a container image with the Dockerfile
- Run a container from the image and load the app in a browser to test
- Tell our manager we're back online!
